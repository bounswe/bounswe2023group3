# Project Development Weekly Progress Report 5
**Team Name:** Group 3 - Prediction Poll  
**Date:** 07.11.2023

## Progress Summary
**Last two weeks**, our preparations were focused on reaching the initial project milestone. We reached our first milestone for the semester and along the way, we completed the welcome, login, signup pages for the frontend and mobile apps, authentication, authorization, and database initializations for the backend. A preliminary version of the home page was also put in place. Lastly, we presented the core structure of our application and the progress made up to that moment. **Looking ahead to the next week**, we plan to refine our existing user and poll functionalities to improve user experience and engagement.
