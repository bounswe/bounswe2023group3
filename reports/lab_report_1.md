# Project Development Weekly Progress Report 1
**Team Name:** Group 3 - Prediction Poll  
**Date:** 4.10.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week**, our team welcomed new members and ensured their access to our key communication channels like Discord, Github, and Whatsapp. We also established sub-teams for backend, frontend, and mobile development, while discussing possible technologies to power our project. **Looking ahead to the next week**, our goal is to review our work from the previous semester, ensuring we are fully prepared to kickstart the implementation phase.

## Risks
- Front-end and mobile teams need to be more proficient in their respective frameworks, the learning time might be longer than expected. We will be using our time efficiently to catch up with the plans we make.
- Revision of requirements and UML diagrams must be done carefully, otherwise there may be many conflicts on backend development.
