# Project Development Weekly Progress Report 6
**Team Name:** Group 3 - Prediction Poll  
**Date:** 14.11.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week**, we created poll entities, implemented poll views and reviewed our work according to milestone 1 feedbacks. Frontend team focused on poll implementation and improved their UI, backend team implemented user and poll relations, and mobile team started moderator components. Overall, the whole team is preparing for the next milestone while integrating the work done by different sub teams. **Looking ahead to the next week**, we will strengthen our poll implementations and add the moderator to our app to make it feel more alive.

## Planned vs. Actual
My adding many to many relationship task([#284](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/284)) is done later than planned time but it is done before the lab.(Batuhan İlhan)

## UI/UX Decisions

We have consistently maintained / are planning to implement these 3 UI/UX best practices
- Using the same design palette with pastel colors across mobile & web
- Using tags to navigate through polls
- Hovering a badge to check its description

We wish to have in our app these features but can't
- Using an LLM as a moderator: it would shorten the approval of the poll requests but it is expensive
- Smart poll suggestions: it would be nice for the users to auto-create polls based on popular upcoming events, but it requires continuous integration

## Risks
- For this week, there are different task focuses for different sub teams. This may lead to different development levels later on. But we will try to integrate our works next week and get on the same page before the next milestone.
