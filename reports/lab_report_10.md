## Planned vs. Actual
* Batuhan Çetin: I implemented two bugfix issues on semantic search issue:[#596](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/596) pr: [#597](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/pull/597), issue: [#598](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/598), pr:[#599](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/pull/599).
* Batuhan Çetin: I implemented moderator fetch polls with isSettled query endpoint issue: [#602](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/602) pr: [#605](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/pull/605).
* Hatice Serra Hakyemez: I couldn't complete [this](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/567) issue.
* Hatice Serra Hakyemez: I forgot that Berk already implemented the [adding sectioning](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/563) task last week, and opened an unnecessary issue. His PR can be seen [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/pull/577). (This was an error on my part, Berk shouldn't be hold accountable)
* Berk: I completed the issue of the previous week. [PR](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/pull/623), for my other [issue](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/516), we have determined the necessary backend implementations with Alp and they are put into this week's tasks.
* Berk: I removed myself from the issues  [#563](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/563) and [#568](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/568) as they were resolved by my friends and my input was not necessary
* Baturhan: after meeting with backend team, I changed my plan from implementing [#570](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/570) to [#588](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/issues/588), [PR](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group3/pull/611). Because, implementing leaderboard is an essential task for our application. We decided to focus on more important tasks to deliver a better application for our customers. In previous lab, we thought implementing notifications page can be good for the app, but then we realized that there are more important tasks, and notifications page is not essential.
