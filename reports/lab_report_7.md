# Project Development Weekly Progress Report 7
**Team Name:** Group 3 - Prediction Poll  
**Date:** 21.11.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week**, we solidified our poll endpoints and implemented moderator related endpoints. We created moderator pages and components, improved our data connections to the backend and made poll lists. **Looking ahead to the next week**, we will be getting ready for the milestone and our second presentation. We will complete some modifications to our app to present a good product on this milestone.

## Scenarios for The Milestone

We have an example scenario that would also be used as a reference for our milestone 2 presentation (the related requirement is noted in a paranthesis next to the step):

- Register with your email: 
     email: `your_email`
     password: 1234567890
     username: poll_striker

- Go to your email and look at your verification code. _(1.1.3)_
- Go to login page enter your credentials: _(1.1.2)_
    email: `your_email`
    password: 1234567890

- You need to fill in your verification code in the page and you will be redirected to home page. (One time only) _(1.1.3)_
- Click on a poll you are interested in from the home page.
- Make a vote to the poll. _(1.3.1)_
- Then change your idea and make an another vote. 
- Like the post. _(1.3.3.)_
- Read the comments and add a comment that you would like to write. _(1.3.2.)_
- Click on the username or user photo and go to user's profile.  _(1.2.3.)_
- Follow user. _(1.3.10.)_
- Look at the users' polls.  _(1.2.1.)_
- Click on create a poll request button on the lefts side of the screen. _(1.3.11.)_
- Enter a poll question you would like to know the predictions of. _(1.3.11)_
- Enter tags as you like. _(1.3.11)_
- Add options as you like. _(1.3.11)_
- Choose a deadline. _(1.3.11)_
- Click send for approval. _(1.3.11)_
- User logs out. _(1.3.13)_
- Meanwhile, a moderator logs in with the given credentials:
    username: xscdscd
    password: xsdjncsdc
- They click on 'see details' button on the corresponding poll request that has been sent for approval. _(1.4.1)_
- They click approval. _(1.4.2)_
- They log out from moderator account _(1.4.7)_
- Log in as user again. _(1.1.2)_
- Click 'my profile' button on the sidebar. Click 'created' section. 
- See your newly created poll and enjoy your polling experience. 

As you can see the implementation features cover most of the user and poll interactions such as liking, voting and commenting on a poll, creating a poll request, and also moderator and poll interactions such as approval or rejection. Moreover, there is user-user interactions like following a user and checking their profile and polls. 

## User Testing Scenario

The scenario given above will hold for the user testing scenario also, but in addition we will have some steps that will test the logic of our app, such as:

- User tries to create a poll without tag. System doesn't allow it. _(1.3.11)_
- User tries to create a poll with an invalid question like "How many ears does a cat have?" or "What is your favourite color?". Moderator rejects this poll request. _(1.4.2.)_
- User tries to reset their password with invalid token. _(1.1.3)_

## Risks
- We have many tasks to cover, and the milestone overlapped with a busy period for all of us so we might face some problems with completing all our plans before the milestone.
