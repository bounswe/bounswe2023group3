# Project Development Weekly Progress Report 2
**Team Name:** Group 3 - Prediction Poll  
**Date:** 10.10.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week**, we completed the revision of our software requirements such as moderator authentication and logout feature, and removed some ambiguities. We decided on the technologies that are going to be used for the front-end, back-end and mobile implementations. **Looking ahead to the next week**, we will be finalizing the revision of our UML diagrams, complete our project plans and get more familiar with the technologies we chose.

## Planned vs. Actual
Except for some tasks, we managed to meet our initial expectations. However we were not able to complete the revision of the project design, the responsibility assignment matrix and the project roadmap due to lack of time. This week we are going to complete these tasks too.

## Risks
- If project plan is prepared carelessly, things may go wrong during the semester. Therefore, we must determine and assign the tasks and timeline rigorously.
- If someone can not learn the his or her subject in a reasonable amount of time, they may not be able to start making contributions, which may cause delay in timeline.
- If we distribute tasks inequally, some members may experience burnout and their productivity may decrease.
